                        <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend
                            Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over
                            to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo
                            Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>

            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
                I used to spend hours and hours learning, then
                try to create simple projects using what I learned
                or work new techniques into existing projects. </p>

            <p>While
                that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                what I was learning and most things about my journey with
                the world.</p>

            <h2>How I got started</h2>

            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                 I would take notes about what I was learning. After each 
                 learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on 
                 what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
                 learned using my own words.</p>
            
                 <p> That helped me grok what I was 
                    learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries 
                    was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
